A collection of useful things to help make it easier to integrate Contentful into your Rails app.

This is a work in progress.

# Things this gem will do

- if [ContentfulModel](http://github.com/errorstudio/content_model) is included in the application, load all the model content type mappings
- provide an endpoint for Contentful webhooks
